## Original Games

  * [Spin: Bryan Gates](https://revo1utionn.github.io/GameSpin/index.html) --- Spin is a arcade based mobile game, were you play as an asteroid drifting in space trying to get the highest spin speed.

  * [First game: Matthew Adams](https://adam1354.github.io/FirstGame/index.html) --- I took a game that I played called ever wing and decided to make my own version to it.

  * [Iron Eagles: Jack Stencil]() --- This is a small version of what will be a larger game where the player controlls a spaceship and has to defend against increasing waves of enemies.

    Defender

  * [Defender: Doug Urner](https://douglasurner.github.io/prototypes/Defender/index.html) --- I modified this game to use the night sky background, I thought that that would look better with the laser. The next thing I want to fix is the way the game ends.
  
  * [Defender: Matthew Kincaid](https://github.com/Matthew-Kincaid/Matthew-Kincaid.github.io) --- I changed the creation rate for the cannon from 0.4 to 0.25. The next thing i did was change the rotation spped of the player from 25 to 40. Finally I made changed the winner score from 5 to 25.

    Lander
  </summary>
    
 * [Lander: Andrew Mattucci](https://andrewmattucci.github.io/Final/index.html) --- I changed a few minor things having to do with rotation and speed of the player. 

 * [Lander: Liam Pratt](https://CaptainLeemo.github.io/buiuld/index.html) --- In "Lander", you have to move a space ship from one point to another. There are obstacles blocking the end point, so it isn't as easy as it sounds.
 
 * [Lander: Alex Young](young0904.github.io lander) --- i changed the speed of the ship so that is it more easier to move around the play area.
